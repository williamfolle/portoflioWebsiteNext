          ðŸš€ My path is marked by an ongoing passion for exploring 
          the boundaries of software development. Over the years, 
          I've had the privilege to work on various personal projects,
          for clients, and companies, where I've applied my expertise 
          across a wide range of technologies,<span className="font-medium">including JavaScript, 
          React, Node.js, Next.js, and TypeScript.</span>  I believe that every 
          problem presents a unique opportunity to create innovative and 
          valuable solutions.
